# Forma New Tab Extension

Forma replaces your new tab with images, from a selection catered to your interests.

## Permissions

Forma requires the following permissions to work:

- `downloads` - Allows the user to download the displayed image with a button click
- `storage` - To store metadata about the next shown image

### Host permissions

- `https://*/`, `http://*/` - Forma loads image urls from any host shared on reddit, not just reddit itself
